# Bench History — Cross-version baseline archive

This directory accumulates **reproducible recall benchmark KPIs** across
every Alaya release that touches recall, embedding, tier, or governance
behavior. It is the durable contract that v0.3.6 establishes for v0.3.7+
and beyond.

The premise: a single one-off benchmark number is theatre. A feedback
loop — same harness, same data, diffed against previous baselines, with
regression thresholds and an Inspector trend line — is engineering.

## Why this exists

- An external reader can re-run `rtk pnpm exec alaya-bench-runner self &&
  rtk pnpm exec alaya-bench-runner longmemeval` and reproduce our
  published numbers.
- Any PR that changes recall / embedding / tier / proposal behavior
  must attach a fresh entry here and link the diff vs. the previous
  baseline in the PR description.
- Inspector reads the last N entries and renders trend lines on
  `/overview` and `/recall`.
- The diff engine encodes regression thresholds in
  `packages/eval/src/thresholds.ts`. A `✗` finding flips the CLI exit
  code, so this archive can be wired into CI later without changing
  contract.

- `<YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSSZ>-<sha7>` combines the ISO-8601 run timestamp (UTC,
  colon-stripped so the path is filesystem-safe) and the **alaya commit
  sha** the harness was run against. Same-day reruns keep their natural
  chronological order under lex sort.
- `latest-baseline.json` is a JSON pointer (`{ "slug": ..., "kpi_path": ... }`)
  rewritten on every successful `writeEntry`. `readLatest` checks this
  pointer first and only falls back to directory listing when the file is
  absent or malformed.
- `findings.md` is emitted by the diff engine when any KPI hits the `✗`
  threshold; it lists the regression, the suspected root cause, and a
  candidate `#BL-XXX` backlog entry. The release relay turn must lift
  these into `docs/handbook/backlog.md`.

## Thresholds (regression verdicts)

Defined in `packages/eval/src/thresholds.ts`. Reference values:

Bands are inclusive (`≥`): a drop of exactly 2.0 pp registers as `warn`,
a drop of exactly 5.0 pp registers as `fail`.

| KPI | ⚠ (warn) | ✗ (fail, exit 1) |
|---|---|---|
| `r_at_5` | drop ≥ 2.0 pp | drop ≥ 5.0 pp |
| `r_at_10` | drop ≥ 2.0 pp | drop ≥ 5.0 pp |
| `latency_ms_p95` | ≥ +20% | ≥ +50% |
| `token_saved_ratio_vs_full_prompt` | drop ≥ 2.0 pp | drop ≥ 5.0 pp |
| golden-set hit | any individual fixture flips hit→miss | ✗ same row |
| `tier_distribution.hot` share | drop ≥ 5.0 pp | drop ≥ 10.0 pp |

A `✗` on any of these makes `alaya-bench-runner` exit non-zero. CI hookup is
optional today; the contract is that the exit code is meaningful.

## Entry errata

This archive is append-mostly. Existing entries are immutable for KPI
fields; only metadata labels (split, dataset.name) may be corrected
when a Phase-N wiring bug wrote the wrong label at write time. Each
correction lists the affected slug + the corrected field + the commit
that did it. **Numbers (R@K, latency, tier_distribution,
degradation_reasons, per_scenario rows) are never rewritten** — to
restate a number, write a new entry.

| Slug | Field | Was | Is | Commit | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `public/2026-05-14T095424Z-01385ce/` | `split` | `longmemeval-s` | `longmemeval-oracle` | dda1f9b | Variant was always Oracle; the v0.3.6 Phase 4 runner hard-coded `split: longmemeval-s`. Phase 5 introduced variant→split mapping. |

## Known bench-harness stderr noise

The `alaya-bench-runner self` and `alaya-bench-runner longmemeval` runs
emit one `MODEL_TOOL candidate signal emitted without source_delivery_ids.`
warning per seed. This is structural and intentional:

- Bench seeds enter through `soul.emit_candidate_signal` over MCP, so
  the daemon stamps them with `source = MODEL_TOOL` per invariants §29
  (the MCP request schema strips the `source` field — MCP callers cannot
  set it themselves).
- `MODEL_TOOL` signals are expected to carry `source_delivery_ids`
  pointing at a prior `soul.recall` delivery. Bench seeds originate
  from dataset fixtures, not from a recall, so no valid anchor exists.
- The daemon's `validateSourceDeliveryAnchors` would reject any synthetic
  id, so threading a fake anchor is not a fix.

The warning is informational; it does not change the propose+review
audit chain captured under `evidence/audit-trail-witness.json`.

## Synthetic scenario versioning

Each scenario in `packages/eval/fixtures/synthetic-recall/*.json` carries
`scenario_id` (stable) + `version` (incremented on edit). The diff engine
matches by `scenario_id`; if a scenario's `version` changes, the diff
engine reports the scenario in `rebaselined_scenarios` rather than as a
hit→miss delta — so editing one scenario does not silently move the
overall R@5 number.

Adding a brand-new `scenario_id` is reported in `new_scenarios`. Both
categories appear in the `report.md` markdown section and in
`KpiDiffResult` returned by the diff engine, but neither contributes to
the worst verdict (they are advisory, not gating).

## Bench harness — degradation diagnostics

`kpi.degradation_reasons` is read straight off the daemon's recall
response — it is not echoed from seed counts. Each probe contributes
exactly one bucket:

- `none` — hot-tier coarse filter returned enough candidates; no cascade.
- `warm_cascade_engaged` — hot tier was empty / underfilled, warm tier
  was searched and produced the merged candidate set.
- `cold_cascade_engaged` — warm tier still underfilled, cold tier was
  searched too.

Why the split between `self` and `public` looks asymmetric:

- `public` (LongMemEval) seeds dozens of haystack turns per question.
  The hot tier is dense, FTS matches are plentiful, and most probes
  return enough hot candidates without ever firing the cascade.
- `self` seeds only the 1–2 setup utterances plus 3–5 distractors per
  scenario. The hot tier is sparse relative to the recall budget, so
  the cascade fires almost every probe and most `self` runs report
  `cold_cascade_engaged=N`. This is real recall behavior on a small
  workspace, not a harness bug. Larger workspaces (e.g. real attached
  agents over a session) will lean back toward `none`.

`harness_mode = "mcp_propose_review"` in `kpi.json` confirms each seed
went through the full propose+review chain
(`soul.emit_candidate_signal → soul.propose_memory_update →
soul.review_memory_proposal accept`). Any KPI carrying
`harness_mode = "direct_db_seed"` is from a pre-v0.3.6 run that
bypassed governance and should not be used as a v0.3.6 baseline.

## How to add a new entry (operator handbook)

```bash
# from the alaya repo root (or any worktree on a branch you want to bench)
rtk pnpm install
rtk pnpm build

# 1. (LongMemEval only) Fetch the public dataset before the first run.
#    Verifies sha256 against datasets/<name>.meta.json and caches the JSON
#    under <data-dir>/longmemeval/.
rtk pnpm exec alaya-bench-runner fetch-longmemeval --variant oracle

# 2. Run the benches. Each writes <split>/<date>T<HHMMSS>Z-<sha7>/ and
#    rewrites the corresponding latest-baseline.json pointer.
rtk pnpm exec alaya-bench-runner self
rtk pnpm exec alaya-bench-runner longmemeval --variant oracle
```

Then commit the new `<date>T<HHMMSS>Z-<sha7>/` directory +
`latest-baseline.json` update. If `findings.md` exists, open the
corresponding backlog entry in the same PR.
