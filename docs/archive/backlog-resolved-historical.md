# Backlog — Resolved Issues (Historical Archive)

This file preserves resolved backlog entries removed from
`docs/handbook/backlog.md` on 2026-06-18 to keep the handbook concise.
Open issues and permanently rejected items remain in the handbook backlog.

## Resolved in audit branch (2026-07-07)

### #BL-065 — Finish strict-index test-suite cleanup

**Status**: Resolved (audit branch closeout, 2026-07-07).

`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` remains enabled in `tsconfig.base.json`. `@do-soul/alaya-core` test typecheck is clean via explicit helpers in `packages/core/src/__tests__/helpers/defined.ts` across 27 test files. Evidence: `rtk pnpm --filter @do-soul/alaya-core run typecheck` exit 0 on branch `audit-2026-07-06-full-fix`.

---

## Resolved in v0.3.11

### #BL-059 — `apps/core-daemon` typecheck.json loose-mock red (I4)

**Status**: Resolved (audit-stability closeout, 2026-07-04).

Surfaced as I4 during the B1 karma-retention fix. `apps/core-daemon/tsconfig.typecheck.json` (test-inclusive) reported loose-mock type errors concentrated in daemon route tests under `apps/core-daemon/src/__tests__/routes/`. Fixed as part of the project-wide typecheck repair (155→0 errors): `LooseStub<T>`, `routeServices<T>()` / `workspaceRouteServices()`, and related support-layer patterns in `apps/core-daemon/src/__tests__/support/` — no `as any`, no tsconfig weakening. Whole-project `rtk pnpm run typecheck` is now clean; CI already gates `pnpm run --if-present typecheck` on every push/PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` Typecheck step, before Build and Test).

### #BL-058 — Karma async-fallback branch scoped test-only + production-guaranteed atomic

**Status**: Resolved (audit-stability closeout, 2026-07-04).

Cover-or-scope resolved as **scope test-only + guarantee production atomic**. The async fallback in `KarmaTransitionEngine.processKarmaEvent` (`packages/core/src/dynamics/karma-transition-engine.ts`) is retained as the ordering-safe path for test fakes that lack the sync ports, and now carries a one-line test-only rationale. Production can no longer silently use it: the daemon guard `requireAtomicKarmaTransition` (`apps/core-daemon/src/runtime/karma-atomic-wiring-guard.ts`, called from `createDynamicsService` in `daemon-knowledge-foundation.ts`) fails fast at wiring time unless the `EventPublisher` and the karma/memory/event-log repos resolve to one `StorageDatabase` connection — so when wiring succeeds, `canRunAtomicTransition()` is true by construction and the atomic branch is taken. This also closes the **2026-07-04c residual risk #1** (the single-transaction guarantee depended on all four participants sharing one connection with nothing enforcing it): the shared-connection prerequisite is now enforced via `getStorageConnectionIdentity()` identity checks, with regression coverage in `apps/core-daemon/src/__tests__/dynamics/karma-atomic-wiring-guard.test.ts` (atomic-capable when shared; throws on a mismatched second connection).

### #BL-049 — Forgetting-lifecycle compress arm activated

**Status**: Resolved (closed in the v0.3.11 closeout fix-loop, 2026-06-04).

The compress arm is now ARMED. All three activation gates were met: (1) `source_memory_refs` producer wired; (2) compress-vs-protection ordering fixed; (3) lossy-summary-preservation documented honestly. Full details in the closeout evidence chain (`5ab7f768`, `fe49ad98`, `3155cf1d`, etc.).

### #BL-050 — Ingest reconciliation default-ON under zero-own-LLM

**Status**: Resolved (closed in the v0.3.11 closeout fix-loop, 2026-06-04).

D-F1 ingest reconciliation runs out of the box on a rule-only, zero-cloud basis. Byte-equal duplicate → NOOP; ambiguous band → ADD. Cloud garden-LLM is optional and default-OFF. `ALAYA_INGEST_RECONCILIATION_ENABLED=0` disables entirely. Close evidence: `d57ace8a`, `90ba64a9`.

### #BL-055 — Inspector Health Inbox path-relation-failure label/filter

**Status**: Resolved on `audit/full-repair-2026-06-14`.

The Inspector Health Inbox now treats `path_relation_failure` as a first-class cause kind with dedicated English and Chinese labels and test coverage.

### #BL-056 — Token-savings ratio as a benchmark-harness contract (LoCoMo gap)

**Status**: Resolved (LoCoMo bench verified 2026-06-08).

The token-economy savings metric is now a harness-level contract (`assertBenchTokenEconomyContract` in `apps/bench-runner/src/harness/token-economy.ts`) satisfied by every integrated benchmark.

## Resolved in v0.3.8

### #BL-039 — Wire real embedding provider into recall path

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.8. `OpenAIEmbeddingClient` confirmed working against yunwu.ai `/v1/embeddings` (text-embedding-3-small, 1536-d).

### #BL-040 — Scale LongMemEval-S smoke to confidence-interval sample

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.8. Wilson CI added via `packages/eval/src/metrics/wilson-ci.ts`; report annotates R@K with half-width and lo/hi bounds.

### #BL-041 — LoCoMo cross-stack comparison

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.8. `apps/bench-runner/src/locomo/` ships dataset schema, sha256-pinned fetcher, and runner. First archive under `docs/bench-history/public-locomo/`.

### #BL-042 — Inspector Memory Browser + command palette

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.8. `MemoryBrowser.tsx` and `CommandPalette.tsx` shipped.

### #BL-045 — PathRelationProposalService counter eviction port

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.8. `evictExpired` exposed; daemon wires unref'd setInterval with `ALAYA_PATHREL_COUNTER_TTL_MS`.

### #BL-046 — ConflictDetectionService rule-path disable toggle

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.8. `ruleEnabled` constructor option; daemon reads `ALAYA_CONFLICT_RULE_ENABLED`.

## Resolved in v0.3.6

### #BL-043 — tool-runtime-bootstrap.test.ts port-3000 parallel flake

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.6 (commit `b8fce04`). Changed to `port: 0` for OS-assigned free port.

---

## Resolved in v0.3.0

### #BL-037 — Codex `/alaya-inspect` host recognition proof

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.0 (negative proof). Codex CLI 0.130.0 does not expose a third-party fixed slash-command registry.

### #BL-038 — Host autonomous use of `soul.*` tools

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.0 (live-usage witness). `scripts/export-host-autonomy-witness.mjs` exports real usage chains; `host-autonomy-witness.test.ts` pins them offline.

---

## Resolved by v0.2.0

### #BL-008 — engine-gateway provider integration via pi-mono

**Status**: Resolved in v0.2.0. `OfficialApiGardenProvider` → pi-mono through `pi-mono-extractor.ts`.

## Resolved — #BL-009 (OS keychain for secrets)

**Status**: Resolved in v0.3.0. `keychain:<service>:<account>` secret refs resolve through platform-native API (macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret / Windows Credential Manager). Code-reviewed on all platforms; runtime keychain write/read not exercised due to WSL2 dev environment. `env:` / `file:` refs are the runtime-verified path.
